Mango Release 2.0

- Note that some Mango features require the latest dmd compiler; the dependencies are related to the new version= behaviour, and various dmd bug fixes

- Please take a look at the mango/examples/ directory

- Mango uses Build.exe for compilation. You can create a Mango.lib by going to the mango/build directory and using Build @mango. However, Build and DMD are so fast that I find it convenient to just avoid lib files. Setting up DMD for Mango is straightforward ~ either add a -I[mango-path] to the command line, or add it to the sc.ini file in the dmd/bin directory. 

- Mango is fully compatible with the latest release of Ares ~ the two libraries tend to stay in sync. Add a -version=Ares to the DMD command-line when compiling for Ares.

- Note that you will need the wsock32.lib (sockets), or equivalent, available within the link path. The earlier ws2_32.lib does not support multicast, and will therefore produce errors.

- In a similar vein, you will need the ICU DLLs (or shared libs) to use the ICU bindings. These should be placed somewhere where the O/S can find them. Mango.icu now requires ICU v3.2

- Note that doxygen fails to include a significant amount of documentation. This is particularly evident where version{} is used, and where nested classes/functions are taken advantage of. Please refer to the source files for complete documentation.

- mango/mango/test/unittest.d is the main test file. Check in there for some additional usage examples.

- Moved mango.sys.Type over to the mango.convert package
- Improved efficiency of URL decoding
- Added Unicode support to printf-style formatting

- FileConduit now derives from DeviceConduit. This was done so that Stdio does not require FileConduit
- Cleaned up some references to Socket internals
- Added Darwin patches from Anders (thanks!)


Release 1.3 changes

- Added special processing for Win32 console output (it doesn't like strings longer than 32K)
- Added a MutableFilePath constructor to accept file names
- Added a new 'File' class to simplify the API. This extends FileProxy, so you get the methods from there also

- File classes now support Win95 & Win32s (thanks to Chris Sauls)
- Added a split() function to the utils.Text class


Release 1.2 changes

- Mango.base.ByteSwap updates from Aleksey Bobnev, who took the time to benchmark various approaches (big thank-you!)
- merged TokenEx back into Token, given new static constructor behavior in dmd 0.115
- added mango.format package
- Added the extended precision floating-point converters by David Gay (wrapped by mango.format.DGDouble)
- changed DisplayWriter to use mango.format
- Added a check for invalid stdio handles in FileConduit
- Cleaned up some cruft in the IWriter/IReader interaces
- Added 'whisper' IO format, as the unoffical Mango standard
- Enhanced support for reading arrays of a pre-determined size. Now uses a second argument instead of the old push() approach; C++ iostream format suffers as a result. 
- Mango.io.Stdio split into mango.io.Stdout and mango.io.Stdin, which reduces baggage for small console programs
- removed some superfluous Phobos imports
- Invalid Stdio handles are quietly ignored (per behaviour of legacy systems)
- ServletContext can now accept independent Logger instances
- Mango.log.Admin had a few public imports which should have been private
- Anders kindly provided a set of patches for both GDC and the Mac (Darwin), along with the appropriate makefile (another big thank-you!)
- removed all dependencies on printf() and sprintf(), except for mango.log
- Http server reverted to HTTP/1.0 since it doesn't support chunking at this time
- Added URegex to the ICU package
- Mango.icu now requires ICU v3.2 (for the URegex package)

Release 1.1 changes

- added UString utility constructor for loading via an IBuffer
- added hadTimeout() method to SocketConduit, for explicit error-checking
- removed some cruft from mango.cluster (an old reference to a specific host name)


Release 1.0a changes

- fixed new const-int errors tagged by dmd 0.107


Release 1.0 changes

- Most version(linux) statements have been changed to version(Posix) instead. Make files should be adjusted accordingly
- ICU wrappers have been fleshed out some more
- UString has a number of additional methods
- Module icu.UMango introduced, which binds the ICU converters into Mango.io
- IArrayAllocator now knows about element widths, and makes adjustments to array.length as appropriate
- Fixed another bug in System.Sleep(), where the Win32 platform was off by a factor of 1000 
- The array lengths read/written by binary readers/writers has changed, from a byte-count to an element-count. This should not affect anything unless you already have persisted data that was originally written by io.Writer
- Delivery of the Mango packages has been split into multiple components
- Added support for all array types to readers/writers. They now support 15 different data types, plus the IReadable/IWritable notion.
- Libraries (for Win32) are now included in the distribution. Linux libs will hopefully be provided in the near future
- FlushBuffer had some design flaws, and has been replaced with FlushWriter instead. Stdio now used the latter, rather than the former, and auto-flushes when a Newline is seen.
- The argument list for icu.UMessageFormat has been reworked
- ICU bindings now operate nicely on linux: a big thank-you to John Reimer.
- Mango.log is now even faster than before, and does zero memory-allocation once running. Supports Phobos, in addition to Mango.io
- UTimeZone.d now has some useful time-zones pre-defined
- Mango.io now uses an alias to support the twin put/get and <</>> syntax (kudos to Ivan Senji).

- System.d moved out of mango.io to mango.base (it never belonged there)

- added an example of cluster alerts
- moved Timer.Interval over to System.Interval instead
- fixed new getErrno() issues due to Phobos changes

- changed timout values to Timer.Interval types instead (e.g. socket timeout)
- added System.getMillisecs() and other related methods
- annotated source code is now part of the documentation (still needs a lot of work!)
- added HttpClient.read() to simplify that part of the process
- added IConduit filter support (see IConduit.attach)
- simplified the client-side of IBuffer, and cleaned up all dependents

Beta 8 changes

- IBuffer.flush() now throws an IOException if there was an IO problem, as does IConduit.copy() which reversed its orientation from IConduit.copyTo() such that it's now possible to chain copy() operations
- FileConduit gets a copy(FilePath) method to simplify file copying
- Further documentation
- Formal introduction of mango.log.Admin; try it out with mango.examples.servlets!
- Http client and server reorganized as described in the dsource forums (both now a subset of mango.http)
- updated to reflect dmd v0.93 .size, char.init, and typeinfo changes

- Fixed typo in Uri.d
- toParent() in FilePath.d now throws an exception if the source object is an orphan
- sprinkled a few more asserts around

- Added RFC 2396 compliant URI implementation (Mango.server.utils.Uri)
- Mango.io.FilePath name-parser was reshaped such that it now actually works
- Lots of changes vis-a-vis Mango.server and Mango.servlet; these will be seperated out of here at some point


Beta 1 changes

- Extended Token support for FP (thanks Chris) -- this needs further attention.
- Added FreeList support for SocketConduit instances returned via ServerSocket.accept()

- updated mango.io.FilePath to take advantage of the above

- Added file random-access example to unittest.d
- added Writer.flush() 
- some further documentation


Alpha 2 Changes
