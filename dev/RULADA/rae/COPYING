Rae GUI Library contains files in several licences, which currently are not 
all compatible with each other. Therefore you can't really use Rae for anything 
real yet, unless you remove the parts with the offending licences, or choose a
licence which is compatible with all the files in Rae, for your work. 
In 2009 we are planning to remove all those parts with the licences that we do not 
wish to use, and replace them all with the X11/MIT style licence.

Here are the licences that we're using:
