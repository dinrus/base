/**
 * Description
 * The g_regex_*() functions implement regular
 * expression pattern matching using syntax and semantics similar to
 * Perl regular expression.
 * Some functions accept a start_position argument,
 * setting it differs from just passing over a shortened string and setting
 * G_REGEX_MATCH_NOTBOL in the case of a pattern that begins with any kind
 * of lookbehind assertion.
 * For example, consider the pattern "\Biss\B" which finds occurrences of "iss"
 * in the middle of words. ("\B" matches only if the current position in the
 * subject is not a word boundary.) When applied to the string "Mississipi"
 * from the fourth byte, namely "issipi", it does not match, because "\B" is
 * always false at the start of the subject, which is deemed to be a word
 * boundary. However, if the entire string is passed , but with
 * start_position set to 4, it finds the second
 * occurrence of "iss" because it is able to look behind the starting point
 * to discover that it is preceded by a letter.
 * Note that, unless you set the G_REGEX_RAW flag, all the strings passed
 * to these functions must be encoded in UTF-8. The lengths and the positions
 * inside the strings are in bytes and not in characters, so, for instance,
 * "\xc3\xa0" (i.e. "Ã ") is two bytes long but it is treated as a single
 * character. If you set G_REGEX_RAW the strings can be non-valid UTF-8
 * strings and a byte is treated as a character, so "\xc3\xa0" is two bytes
 * and two characters long.
 * When matching a pattern, "\n" matches only against a "\n" character in the
 * string, and "\r" matches only a "\r" character. To match any newline sequence
 * use "\R". This particular group matches either the two-character sequence
 * CR + LF ("\r\n"), or one of the single characters LF (linefeed, U+000A, "\n"), VT
 * (vertical tab, U+000B, "\v"), FF (formfeed, U+000C, "\f"), CR (carriage return,
 * U+000D, "\r"), NEL (next line, U+0085), LS (line separator, U+2028), or PS
 * (paragraph separator, U+2029).
 * The behaviour of the dot, circumflex, and dollar metacharacters are affected by
 * newline characters, the default is to recognize any newline character (the same
 * characters recognized by "\R"). This can be changed with G_REGEX_NEWLINE_CR,
 * G_REGEX_NEWLINE_LF and G_REGEX_NEWLINE_CRLF compile options,
 * and with G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_ANY, G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_CR,
 * G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_LF and G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_CRLF match options.
 * These settings are also relevant when compiling a pattern if
 * G_REGEX_EXTENDED is set, and an unescaped "#" outside a character class is
 * encountered. This indicates a comment that lasts until after the next
 * newline.
 * Creating and manipulating the same GRegex structure from different
 * threads is not a problem as GRegex does not modify its internal
 * state between creation and destruction, on the other hand GMatchInfo is
 * not threadsafe.
 * The regular expressions low level functionalities are obtained through
 * the excellent PCRE library
 * written by Philip Hazel.
